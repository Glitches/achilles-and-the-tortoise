## Step 1

In this workshop we will create a simple producer and consumer.

They will use the queue `queue-test` to produce and consume messages.

Consumer and producer will be placed in the folder of the same name.

Your producer will produce messages in a infinity loop.

Your consumer will consume messages continuosly.
